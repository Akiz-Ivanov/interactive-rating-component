## My process

### Built with

- **React** – for component-based architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** – for utility-first styling
- **Flexbox** – for layout and responsive structure
- **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I learned

During this project, I focused on creating a smooth user experience for selecting a rating and providing dynamic content changes. I implemented a state-driven approach to switch between the rating form and the "thank-you" card after submission. Tailwind CSS helped streamline the responsive design, ensuring the layout adapted well across different screen sizes.
